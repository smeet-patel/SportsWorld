# SportsWorld(HTML,CSS,JS,PHP)

<h3 style="color:blue;>Objective: </h3>
Create a website or web application using the five languages. HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP with MariaDB which uses SQL. 

<h3>Proposes of the project: </h3>
It has been some time since I have personally done some HTML, CSS apart from Workshop tutoring at VUW for INFO 101. 
Secondly wanted build on my Javascript knowledge. 
I wanted to learn about PHP and to use MariaDB.  
So far I have been limited integrating SQL with the web-based application and have used JSON data structure before. 
Since I am using this personal project as a foundation for my future web-based projects, I have restricted myself with the time constraint of 3 days (during own time, after usual daily activities).

Sports World is a website which is a central sports supporter site for various teams and athletes.  It also has a Login and new user registration which uses PHP and SQL to make the website more useful.
